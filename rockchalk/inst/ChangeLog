2013-02-19  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (testSlopes): Sunthud Pornprasertmanit
	suggests 2013-02-19 there is a bug, diag is applied to a singleton.

2013-02-17  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (myPredict): class set to rockchalk3d

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): class set to rockchalk2d.

	* ../R/plotCurves.R (## carrier.name): class set to rockchal2d.

	* ../R/utils.R (cutByTable): make sure return value is a factor
	for factor x, and numeric for numeric x

2013-02-16  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (predictOMatic): return NOT invisible()
	anymore. Why did I do that at before?

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): removed moderator variable name
	from legnd variable, after adding variable name to legend title

	* ../R/utils.R (cutByTable): Fixed the longstanding bug that
	cutTable did not return the desired values (had names and
	values reversed in role). Now output same meaning as
	cutByQuantile


2012-06-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (## carrier.name): using model.data now, and
	varNamesRHS, no need for carrier nonsense anymore.

2012-06-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotCurves.R (carrier.name): revise to use model.data
	function, including the attribute varNamesRHS. Cleans up use of
	carrier data.

2012-05-29  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (formulaReplace): rework code so centered
	variables are re-named with "c" on end. Otherwise too confusing.

	* standardize: re-work to change variable names by appending s.

	* centerNumerics: new function, will add centered variables to a
	data frame with new names with "c" or "cs" appended.

2012-05-28  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (predict.mcreg): predict must use same mean
	and scale as were used in original regression. Use meanCenter
	centeredValues return more fully.
	* meanCenter(std): eliminate use of R scale, now calculate
	mean and scale factors, return them in list with centered
	variables.

2012-05-27  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (carrier.name): use model.data, fix centerValues

	* ../R/residualCenter.R (createRCinteraction): Noticed that this
	function did not work with categorical variables in
	interactions. MASSIVELY reworked calculation approach. Because R
	generates new variables when it finds factors, a new, completely
	literal approach is taken. From fitted model, get the design
	matrix, notice the colnames are the variables in a linear
	formula. Scan through there and replace variables with colons with
	the residual centered versions.

2012-05-19  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/recodeFactors.R (adjacent): fix flaw in ordered factor
	re-calculation (had *again* made the "levels" mistake on the RHS)

2012-05-13  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: x1floor and x2floor. Bad names?  Number of
	divider lines to draw in floor of plot. Default 5, which was the
	value I had hard coded before.

	* ../R/perspEmpty.R (perspEmpty): clean up interface! Use x1 and
	x2 arguments  to position the bottom grids.  Will require
	interface cleanups in other functions.
	
	* ../R/mcGraph (mcGraph1-3): Changes to make usage match
	perspEmpty intercface change. Instead of assuming perspEmpty will
	manufacture the plot sequences, now the caller must do so.

2012-05-07  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (myPredict): move draw arrows before points, so
	arrows sit under, not over points

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): name elements in returned list

2012-05-06  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): llwd: lwd to pass through to
	lines. lwd controls darkness of points only.

	* ../R/outreg.R (outreg): fix conditional at end to insert
	\end{table} to match previous changes to top of function

2012-05-05  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/magRange.R (magRange): work to allow mult smaller than
	1. Range can shrink to (center, center) point when mult reaches 0.

2012-04-29  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/summarize.R (summarizeNumerics): insert N output for summarize

2012-04-28  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/utils.R (cutByQuantile): work out n to divide interval
	according to a special scheme
	(cutBySD): choose between n=3 and 4

	* ../R/summarize.R (summarizeFactors): if no factors found, return NULL
	(summarizeNumerics): if no numerics, return NULL

2012-04-20  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/summarize.R: sumstat: new paramter to restrict diagnostic output
	(summarizeNumerics): fix crash when data frame does not includes
	only factors or only numerics. Returns NULL in summarizeNumerics
	or summarizeFactors.

2012-04-15  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (standardize.lm): drop=FALSE for dm, keeps it
	a matrix
	(summary.mcreg): drop=FALSE for dm

2012-04-04  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (testSlopes): fixing plots. red intervals on "either
	side" result. Labels too.

2012-04-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotCurves.R (cutBySD): insert "col" option, similar to plotSlopes

2012-03-31  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R: allow user to specify colors in plot. add
	option plotLegend.

	* ../R/outreg.R (outreg): fixing problem that title did not print
	unless LyX=FALSE

2012-03-29  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/summarize.R (ncw): new method print.factorSummaries

2012-03-09  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* examples/meanCenter-ex.R: remove references to centerContrasts

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): predict.mcreg centers all variable in the
	"centeredVars" list.
	* ../R/meanCenter.R: Cut "centerContrasts" option in meanCenter and tons of
	beautiful code because it is impossible to manage re-centering in
	predict.mcreg if there are centered congrasts. 

2012-03-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* examples/predict.rcreg-ex.R: new file to demo predict

	* ../R/residualCenter.R (predict.rcreg): new method handles
	by re-calcuating predictions for each auxiliary regression.

2012-03-01  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): Found really bad bug where
	plotPlane(meanCenter) returned error about predict being
	used for wrong type of data. Problem traced back to fact
	that "scale" returns a matrix with 1 column, rather than
	a numeric vector, so dataClasses was mismatched.
	attr(,"dataClasses")
          y         xxx         x22
	"numeric" "nmatrix.1" "nmatrix.1".  The "newdata" I'd
	generate did not have "nmatrix.1" as the type, and so
	predict's use of .MFCheckClass resulted in failure.
	Like others, I say "How aggravating."

2012-02-01  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): "std.dev." and "quantile" now
	legal strings for modxVals, along with particular values.

2012-01-30  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (plotPlane.default): correct typos referring to plotSlopes

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): add na.rm=TRUE for range commands

2012-01-25  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): change return value to include newdf

2012-01-09  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCformula): weird. data from residuals turns up
	with class "AsIs" and causes all kinds of confusion later
	* residualCenter now a generic method
	* residualCenter.default should work for any glm or lm.

2012-01-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): create class name for mean centered
	regression, add attributes.
	print.mcreg: new method

2011-12-30  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (carrier.name): use get_all_vars to build emf

2011-12-28  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: insert plotPoints option to suppress plotting
	of points.  Question. Should plotPoints=FALSE force drawArrows=FALSE?

2011-12-12  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSeq.R: allow x to be a factor, return levels if so

	* /pauljohn.plotSeq.R (plotSeq): range
	allow missings

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: new introduced function

2011-12-11  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../DESCRIPTION (Date): Version: bump

	* ../R/perspEmpty.R (perspEmpty): range(na.rm=TRUE) allow missings

	* ../R/magRange.R (magRange): range(na.rm=TRUE) to allow missings

2011-12-06  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCformula): This is necessary so that all
	interactive components are included
	iv <- paste("(", gsub(":"," + ",x),")^2") 
	* Replace whole stucture to make sure x1.X.x2 coding gets used.

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): trying to fix that pesky "one
	extra variable" error in regression models

2011-12-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): fix problem when only one
	variable was left in calculating centralized predictor values. The
	bare vector has to be told "as.data.frame"

2011-12-01  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCresiduals): revised bug in calculation lmrc
	was not using residual centered variables when "x1:x2" was
	included, R was constructing own product term. So necessary to
	re-name the residual centered variable connector .X.

2011-11-26  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): added option drawArrows

2011-11-05  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): insert invisible() on returns

	* ../R/rockchalk-package.R: insert dataset religioncrime and
	documentation.
	* data/religioncrime.RData: new dataset with beautiful example
	of suppression

2011-11-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* rockchalk/rockchalk/R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): more fiddling
	with interaction

	* mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): fix interaction code in lm
