	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): try to grab the
	predict-intended arguments out of the dotargs.
	* Use predictCI to calculate predictions.

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (predictOMatic): predictCI new function
	tries to give c(fit, lwr, upr) for lm and glm. Maybe others.
	* tie that into predictOMatic, so interval can be returned.
	* tie that into plotSlopes, so glm interval can be plotted.

2013-05-09  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): predict and dotargs.

2013-05-07  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): opacity new argument. 

2013-05-06  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): noticed that meanCenter did not work
	with glm, and don't see why it shouldn't, as long as centerDV is
	handled properly.

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (predictOMatic): had duplicate usage of
	predict that caused it to fail.

2013-05-05  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): yet still more futzing about
	with color matching of factor levels, points, lines, and regions.

2013-05-04  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): color fix for user=specified
	color matrices

2013-05-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* examples/plotSlopes-ex.R: add prestige interaction at end.
	Used dev.new(). hope that's not a violation.

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): Yet more battle to match
	factor and numeric modx colors and line types.
	TODO: llwd still problematic
		fix plotCurves.R similarly

2013-05-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): frustrating problem with
	colors assigned to points, lines, intervals, and legend items
	when user selects just a few values for plotting.

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (predict.mcreg):  The drop gotcha again.
	tmeans <- sapply(newdata[ , nc], mean, na.rm=T) must be:
	tmeans <- sapply(newdata[ , nc, drop = FALSE], mean, na.rm=T)

2013-04-30  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/outreg.R (sigtest): nobs -> stats::nobs because gdata had
	its own nobs

2013-04-29  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/outreg.R (outreg2HTML) had to be exported.

	* (outreg) new outreg, that creates a character vector
	and cats it to screen, and returns it as well.
	* (outreg2HTML): new function that can write an html
	file.

2013-04-27  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/outreg.R (checkReg): check if model has methods summary,
	coef, vcov, and nobs
	* outreg: be more careful receiving modelList, checking if it
	is a regression model.

2013-04-24  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (plot.testSlopes): fix typo in which numeral 2
	was replated by Tcrit in bsse calculation

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (newdata): fixing predVals declaration
	* outreg: multiple alpha values

2013-04-23  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/outreg.R: found bug where df.residual was not
	correct for each separate model. fixed!

2013-04-22  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@pols110.pols.ku.edu>

	* ../R/utils.R (getFocal: create separate documentation for
	the methods, try to clarify usage
	(cutBySD): allow m+/-3sd

2013-04-21  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (focalVals): allow divider to be a
	function, such as R's built-in pretty() function.
	- create new argument "predVals" to replace fl

	* Version 1.7.4.1
	* ../R/genCorrelatedData.R: Added whole family of new
	funcions
	- genCorrelatedData2
	- vech2Corr
	- vech2Mat
	- lazyCor
	- lazyCov
	- makeVec
	- makeSymmetric
	- checkPosDef

	* ../R/mcDiagnose.R (getDeltaRsquare): drop = FALSE should return
	a matrix with one column
	- more revision on getPartialCor

2013-04-19  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/mcDiagnose.R (mcDiagnose): getPartialCor function added.

2013-04-18  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (predictOMatic): fiddling interface for fl
	so it can now be offered as a vector or a list. Trying to get cute
	with way users can specify divider algorithms.

	* ../R/utils.R: must now export the cutBy functions

2013-04-17  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/mcDiagnose.R (getDeltaRsquare): clean up output. Because
	I was using na.omit to get rid of the missing first element (some
	noise from matrix subtraction), the output object was including a
	lot of extraneous attributes that made printing the result more
	tedious. Now I don' use na.omit any more.

2013-04-16  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/outreg.R (harvest): Again reworking arguments, rename
	extraSums to "request" and extraFuns to "runFuns". More examples.
	- new arguments, alpha.

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (focalVals): new function, a wrapper
	around divider functions.
	* outreg: renaming arguments

2013-04-15  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (predictOMatic): introduce "AUTO"
	keyword for focus list variables.

	* ../R/outreg.R (gofPrint): rewrite to add extraFuns and
	extraSums. Mostly working.
	(outreg): fixing logical flaw when a model has NO summaries we
	want. Fighting with nonNull attr

2013-04-14  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/outreg.R (outreg): Reformat consistent with Rstyle
	- change lyx = TRUE argument to float = FALSE.
	(outreg): reworked to grab B and SE matrices, create PT
	at top.

2013-04-10  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (plot.testSlopes): because of mis-match
	between roots and edges of MMlwr and MMupr, re-designed this
	to calculate interval types and ranges exactly, iterate
	over intervals to shade appropriately. Still Ugly code,
	only slightly less embarrassing.

2013-04-09  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (plot.testSlopes): Fixing MMupr and MMlwr
	selection and thinning.

2013-04-08  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (plot.testSlopes): add shade argument to
	stop the pink shading. TODO. allow user color choice.
	* Found Bug on MMlwr and MMupr: don't exclude middle
	in two-ended significant interval. Must think harder.

	* ../R/utils.R (cutByQuantile): now allow n=2 imply quantiles 25
	and 75.

	* examples/testSlopes-ex.R: new example for testSlopes, cut
	example code from testSlopes.R

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (testSlopes): requires plotSlopes object

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): class now "plotSlopes" and
	"rockChalk". plotPlane works with all 2d rockchalk objects, but
	testSlopes only works with plotSlopes so far

2013-04-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* examples/meanCenter-ex.R: use new "terms" argument to specify
	variable to be centered.

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (print.summary.stdreg): meanCenter=add
	terms argument to allow user to circumvent the automatic
	variable selection and force the centering to be done.

2013-03-31  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* Examples: plotCurves-ex, plotSlopes-ex: show new features

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (testSlopes): pass inroot into jn, so the plot
	function can check it.

	* ../R/plotCurves.R (plotCurves): now accepts modx as option,
	will plot without it.
	* legend and color re-fitted.  Nearly going insane maintaining
	almost identical plotSlopes and plotCurves. Must regain sanity.

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes.lm): clean up color
	access, fix legend

2013-03-29  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (addLines): saved the col value in the
	return of plotSlopes. Use that in addLines unless user said
	otherwise in col argument.

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R: working through assinine decisions I
	carelessly made on changing handling of interval in plotSlopes.
	Now behavior slightly more predictable. But frustating.

2013-03-28  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): revise to allow missing or null
	modx.
	* note bug in color assignment for points with factors. Fixed.

2013-03-27  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (testSlopes): separate calculation of
	testSlopes data from plotting and printing methods.
	(plot.testSlopes): plot.testSlopes is sorta-working now,
	not cleaned up.

	* massively clean up logic, eliminate nested loops by
	returning when phase of calculation is finished.
	* fix VERY STUPID variable names that have the dash
	in them. "hypo-test" was just dumb.


2013-03-26  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/utils.R (cutBySD): Changed "cutNumeric" and "cutFactor" to
	a generic function "getFocal" with methods getFocal.default and
	getFocal.factor.
	(getFocal.factor): convert to if/return stanzas.

	* predictOMatic.R (model.data):  silencing warning
	about re-used row names. Warning was triggered by
	this "data <- data.frame(ldata[varNames])" "Warning in
	data.row.names(row.names, rowsi, i) :  some row.names duplicated:
	3,5, --> row.names NOT used" This was a harmless warning, but
	bothersome to users.
	* Rename rnOrigData -> origDataRN

2013-03-24  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/utils.R (cutNumeric): New function to integrate work that
	was duplicated in many separate functions, plotSlopes, plotCurves
	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): interval argument
	* Use new cutNumeric function to find interesting values in a
	numeric plotx
	* plot sub-routine for shaded pred or conf intervals
	* incorporate newdata() function, replace ad-hoc code
	* n argument to feed to newdata()

2013-02-19  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (testSlopes): Sunthud Pornprasertmanit
	suggests 2013-02-19 there is a bug, diag is applied to a singleton.

2013-02-17  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (myPredict): class set to rockchalk3d

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): class set to rockchalk2d.

	* ../R/plotCurves.R (## carrier.name): class set to rockchal2d.

	* ../R/utils.R (cutByTable): make sure return value is a factor
	for factor x, and numeric for numeric x

2013-02-16  pauljohn  <pauljohn@debian.sunflower.com>

	* ../R/predictOMatic.R (predictOMatic): return NOT invisible()
	anymore. Why did I do that at before?

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): removed moderator variable name
	from legnd variable, after adding variable name to legend title

	* ../R/utils.R (cutByTable): Fixed the longstanding bug that
	cutTable did not return the desired values (had names and
	values reversed in role). Now output same meaning as
	cutByQuantile


2012-06-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (## carrier.name): using model.data now, and
	varNamesRHS, no need for carrier nonsense anymore.

2012-06-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotCurves.R (carrier.name): revise to use model.data
	function, including the attribute varNamesRHS. Cleans up use of
	carrier data.

2012-05-29  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (formulaReplace): rework code so centered
	variables are re-named with "c" on end. Otherwise too confusing.

	* standardize: re-work to change variable names by appending s.

	* centerNumerics: new function, will add centered variables to a
	data frame with new names with "c" or "cs" appended.

2012-05-28  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (predict.mcreg): predict must use same mean
	and scale as were used in original regression. Use meanCenter
	centeredValues return more fully.
	* meanCenter(std): eliminate use of R scale, now calculate
	mean and scale factors, return them in list with centered
	variables.

2012-05-27  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (carrier.name): use model.data, fix centerValues

	* ../R/residualCenter.R (createRCinteraction): Noticed that this
	function did not work with categorical variables in
	interactions. MASSIVELY reworked calculation approach. Because R
	generates new variables when it finds factors, a new, completely
	literal approach is taken. From fitted model, get the design
	matrix, notice the colnames are the variables in a linear
	formula. Scan through there and replace variables with colons with
	the residual centered versions.

2012-05-19  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/recodeFactors.R (adjacent): fix flaw in ordered factor
	re-calculation (had *again* made the "levels" mistake on the RHS)

2012-05-13  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: x1floor and x2floor. Bad names?  Number of
	divider lines to draw in floor of plot. Default 5, which was the
	value I had hard coded before.

	* ../R/perspEmpty.R (perspEmpty): clean up interface! Use x1 and
	x2 arguments  to position the bottom grids.  Will require
	interface cleanups in other functions.
	
	* ../R/mcGraph (mcGraph1-3): Changes to make usage match
	perspEmpty intercface change. Instead of assuming perspEmpty will
	manufacture the plot sequences, now the caller must do so.

2012-05-07  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (myPredict): move draw arrows before points, so
	arrows sit under, not over points

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): name elements in returned list

2012-05-06  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): llwd: lwd to pass through to
	lines. lwd controls darkness of points only.

	* ../R/outreg.R (outreg): fix conditional at end to insert
	\end{table} to match previous changes to top of function

2012-05-05  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/magRange.R (magRange): work to allow mult smaller than
	1. Range can shrink to (center, center) point when mult reaches 0.

2012-04-29  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/summarize.R (summarizeNumerics): insert N output for summarize

2012-04-28  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/utils.R (cutByQuantile): work out n to divide interval
	according to a special scheme
	(cutBySD): choose between n=3 and 4

	* ../R/summarize.R (summarizeFactors): if no factors found, return NULL
	(summarizeNumerics): if no numerics, return NULL

2012-04-20  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/summarize.R: sumstat: new paramter to restrict diagnostic output
	(summarizeNumerics): fix crash when data frame does not includes
	only factors or only numerics. Returns NULL in summarizeNumerics
	or summarizeFactors.

2012-04-15  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (standardize.lm): drop=FALSE for dm, keeps it
	a matrix
	(summary.mcreg): drop=FALSE for dm

2012-04-04  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/testSlopes.R (testSlopes): fixing plots. red intervals on "either
	side" result. Labels too.

2012-04-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotCurves.R (cutBySD): insert "col" option, similar to plotSlopes

2012-03-31  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R: allow user to specify colors in plot. add
	option plotLegend.

	* ../R/outreg.R (outreg): fixing problem that title did not print
	unless LyX=FALSE

2012-03-29  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/summarize.R (ncw): new method print.factorSummaries

2012-03-09  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* examples/meanCenter-ex.R: remove references to centerContrasts

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): predict.mcreg centers all variable in the
	"centeredVars" list.
	* ../R/meanCenter.R: Cut "centerContrasts" option in meanCenter and tons of
	beautiful code because it is impossible to manage re-centering in
	predict.mcreg if there are centered congrasts. 

2012-03-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* examples/predict.rcreg-ex.R: new file to demo predict

	* ../R/residualCenter.R (predict.rcreg): new method handles
	by re-calcuating predictions for each auxiliary regression.

2012-03-01  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): Found really bad bug where
	plotPlane(meanCenter) returned error about predict being
	used for wrong type of data. Problem traced back to fact
	that "scale" returns a matrix with 1 column, rather than
	a numeric vector, so dataClasses was mismatched.
	attr(,"dataClasses")
          y         xxx         x22
	"numeric" "nmatrix.1" "nmatrix.1".  The "newdata" I'd
	generate did not have "nmatrix.1" as the type, and so
	predict's use of .MFCheckClass resulted in failure.
	Like others, I say "How aggravating."

2012-02-01  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): "std.dev." and "quantile" now
	legal strings for modxVals, along with particular values.

2012-01-30  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (plotPlane.default): correct typos referring to plotSlopes

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): add na.rm=TRUE for range commands

2012-01-25  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): change return value to include newdf

2012-01-09  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCformula): weird. data from residuals turns up
	with class "AsIs" and causes all kinds of confusion later
	* residualCenter now a generic method
	* residualCenter.default should work for any glm or lm.

2012-01-03  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/meanCenter.R (std): create class name for mean centered
	regression, add attributes.
	print.mcreg: new method

2011-12-30  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R (carrier.name): use get_all_vars to build emf

2011-12-28  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: insert plotPoints option to suppress plotting
	of points.  Question. Should plotPoints=FALSE force drawArrows=FALSE?

2011-12-12  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSeq.R: allow x to be a factor, return levels if so

	* /pauljohn.plotSeq.R (plotSeq): range
	allow missings

	* ../R/plotPlane.R: new introduced function

2011-12-11  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../DESCRIPTION (Date): Version: bump

	* ../R/perspEmpty.R (perspEmpty): range(na.rm=TRUE) allow missings

	* ../R/magRange.R (magRange): range(na.rm=TRUE) to allow missings

2011-12-06  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCformula): This is necessary so that all
	interactive components are included
	iv <- paste("(", gsub(":"," + ",x),")^2") 
	* Replace whole stucture to make sure x1.X.x2 coding gets used.

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): trying to fix that pesky "one
	extra variable" error in regression models

2011-12-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/plotSlopes.R (plotSlopes): fix problem when only one
	variable was left in calculating centralized predictor values. The
	bare vector has to be told "as.data.frame"

2011-12-01  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/lmrc.R (makeRCresiduals): revised bug in calculation lmrc
	was not using residual centered variables when "x1:x2" was
	included, R was constructing own product term. So necessary to
	re-name the residual centered variable connector .X.

2011-11-26  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): added option drawArrows

2011-11-05  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* ../R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): insert invisible() on returns

	* ../R/rockchalk-package.R: insert dataset religioncrime and
	documentation.
	* data/religioncrime.RData: new dataset with beautiful example
	of suppression

2011-11-02  pauljohn  <pauljohn@pjlap-124.ku.edu>

	* rockchalk/rockchalk/R/mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): more fiddling
	with interaction

	* mcGraph.R (mcGraph3): fix interaction code in lm
