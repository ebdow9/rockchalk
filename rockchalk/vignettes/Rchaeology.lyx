\begin_layout Section
Introduction: R Idioms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This vignette is about the R idioms I have learned while working on the
 rockchalk package.
 At the current time, I don't understand all of the R idioms that are common
 in the advanced R programmers' conversation, but I have a grasp on many
 of the staples that I have noticed before, and not understood.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a language gap between an R user and an R programmer.
 Users write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scripts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that use functions from R packages.
 Users don't write (many) functions.
 Users don't make packages.
 And many users are happy to keep it that way.
 For users who want to become programmers, there is usually a harsh awakening.
 R for development is a different language.
 Well, that's wrong.
 It is a different dialect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A transitional R user will have to learn a lot of terminology and undergo
 a change of paradigm.
 There are resources available! Everybody should subscribe to the email
 lists for the R project 
(
\lang english

\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.r-project.org/mail.html
\end_layout

\end_inset

), especially r-help (for user questions) and r-devel.
 Rchaeologically speaking, that is the native habitat of the R programmers.
 There is also a burgeoning collection of blogs and Web forums, perhaps
 most notably the R section on StackExchange (
\begin_inset Flex URL

).
 Excellent books have been published.
 As an Rcheologist, I am drawn to the books that are written by the R insiders.
 
\emph on
S Programming
\emph default
, by William Venables and Brian Ripley (2000), is a classic.
 Books by pioneering developers Robert Gentleman, 
\emph on
R Programming for Bioinformatics
\emph default
 (2009), and John Chambers, 
\emph on
Software for Data Analysis
\emph default
 (2009), are, well, awesome.
 In 2012, I started teaching R programming using Norman Matloff's, 
\emph on
The Art of R Programming
\emph default
 (2012), which I think is great and recommend strongly (even though Professor
 Matloff is not one of the R Core Team members, so far as I know).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are now three types of object-oriented programming in R (S3, S4, and
 reference classes) and the programmer is apparently free to select among
 them without prejudice.
 The best brief explanation of S3 that I've found is in Friedrich Leisch's
 brief note about R packaging, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Creating R Packages: A Tutorial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (2009).
 One should be mindful of the fact that R is provided with several manuals,
 one of which is the 
\emph on
R Language Definition
\emph default
.
 I find that one difficult to understand, and I usually can't understand
 it until I search through the R source code and packages for usage examples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
do.call(), eval(), substitute(), formula().
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the transitional programmer understands these four functions, R programming
 will become much more understandable.

\begin_layout Subsection
Rewriting Formulas.
 My Introductory Puzzle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On May 29, 2012, I was working on a regression problem in the rockchalk
 package.
 I have a number of functions that receive elementary regressions and then
 change them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The functions meanCenter() and residualCenter() receive a fitted regression
 model, transform some variables, and then fit a new regression.
 They have to change the data used by the regressions, and they have to
 revise the regression formulae.
 The non-centered variable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is has to be centered to create 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

x1c
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The original formula y ~ x1*x2 must be replaced with y ~ x1c*x2c.
 I found this to be a very complicated problem with a very satisfying answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My first effort used R's update function.
 That is the most obvious approach, it is the one that was recommended on
 r-help.
 I learned that update() is not sufficient.
 It is fairly easy to replace x1 with x1c in the formula, but not when x1
 is logged or otherwise transformed.
 Here is the runable example code that demonstrates the problem.

That's quintessential R.
 It packs together a half-dozen very deep thoughts.
 It has most of the essential secrets of R's guts, laid out in a single
 line.
 It has do.call(), substitute(), it interprets a formula as a list, and it
 shows that every command in R is, when it comes down to brass tacks, a
 list.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would like to take up these separate pieces in order.

While struggling with this, I noticed this really interesting thing.
 The solution depends on it.
 The object 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is not just a text string.
 It prints out as if it were text, but it is actually an R list object.
 Its parts can be probed recursively, to eventually reveal all of the individual
 pieces:

do.call() and eval()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In my early work as an Rchaeologist, I had noticed eval and do.call, but
 did not understand their significance in the mind of the R programmers.
 Whenever difficult problems arose in r-help, the answer almost invariably
 involved do.call or eval.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
do.call()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's concentrate on do.call first.
 The syntax is like this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

do.call("someRFunction", aListOfArgumentsToGoInTheParentheses)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is as if we were telling R to run this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

someRFunction(aListOfArgumentsToGoInTheParentheses)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider an example that runs a regression the ordinary way, and then
 with do.call.
 In this example, the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

someRFunction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will be played by lm and the list of arguments will be the parameters of
 the regression.
 The regression m1 will be constructed the ordinary way, while m2 is constructed
 with do.call.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The object regargs is a list of arguments that R can understand when they
 are supplied to the lm function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
do.call() is a powerful, mysterious symbol.
 It holds flexibility; we can calculate commands and then run them.
 I first needed it when we had a simulation project that ran very slowly
 when confronted with medium or large sized problems.
 There's a writeup in the working examples distributed with rockchalk called
 stackListItems-01.R.
 I was using rbind over and over to join the results of simulation runs.
 Basically, the code was like this
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

for (i in 1:10000){
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   dat <- someHugeSimulation(i)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   result <- rbind(result, dat)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That will call rbind() 10000 times.
 I had not realized that rbind() is a comparatively time-consuming task
 because it accesses a new chunk of memory each time it is run.
 On the other hand, we could collect those results in a list, then we can
 call rbind one time to smash together all of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

for (i in 1:10000){
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

   mylist[[i]] <- someHugeSimulation(i)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

result <- do.call("rbind", mylist)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is much faster to run rbind only once.
 It would be OK if we typed it all out like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

result <- rbind(mylist[[1]],mylist[[2]],mylist[[3]],mylist[[4]], ..., mylist[[10000
])
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But who wants to do all of that typing? How tiresome! Thanks to Erik Iverson
 in r-help, I understand that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

result <- do.call("rbind", mylist)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is doing the EXACT same thing.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mylist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a list of arguments.
 do.call is 
\emph on
constructing
\emph default
 a function call from the list of arguments.
 It is 
\emph on
as if
\emph default
 I had actually typed rbind with 10000 arguments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The beauty in this is that we could design a program that can assemble the
 list of arguments, and also choose the function to be run, on the fly.
 We are not required to literally write the function in quotes, as in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rbind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 We could instead have a variable that is calculated to select one function
 among many, and then use do.call on that.
 In a very real sense, we could write a program that can write itself as
 it runs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From all of this (and a peek at ?call), I arrive at an Rchaeological eureka!
 A call object is a quoted command plus a list of arguments for that command.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
eval()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where does eval fit into the picture? As far as I can tell, do.call("rbind",
 mylist) is basically the same as eval(call(
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rbind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, mylist)).
 The call() function manufactures the call object, the eval() function tells
 it to do its work.
 I think of do.call() as a contraction of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eval
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

call
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 eval() evaluates any valid R expression, and a call is a valid expression.
 I'm leaving the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is an expression
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to a later time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a quick example that repeats the two regressions exercise that was
 completed with do.call.
 Now I'll create an expression regargs2.
 Note it is necessary for me to evaluate the expression before the lm function
 can understand it.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main reason for using eval is that we can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

piece together
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 commands and then run them after we have assembled all the pieces.
 
\end_layout

 it) by using this code.

If I declare f1exp as an expression, then R does not re-interpret it as
 a formula (f1exp is an unevaluated expression, the R parser has not translated
 it yet).
 To use that as a formula in the regression, we have to evaluate it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we turn back to the main theme.
 How is eval() used in functions? Some functions take a lot of arguments.
 They need to pick some arguments, and send those to some functions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider the lm() code in some detail.
 Suppose a user submits a command like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lm(y ~ x, data = dat, x = TRUE, y = TRUE).
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Inside lm(), it is necessary to pick through those arguments and then pass
 them off to other functions in order to build the data matrix and so forth.
 Here are the first lines of the lm() function
\end_layout

\end_layout

Lets consider what those lines do with a command like this.
\end_layout

m1 <- lm(y ~ x1*x2, data=dat, x = TRUE, y = TRUE)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lm function notices that I supply some arguments.
 In line 8, the match.call function is used to grab a copy of the command
 that I typed.
 If we use R's debugging facility to stop the program at that point, we
 would see that mf is exactly the same as my command, except R has named
 the arguments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

lm(formula = y ~ x1 * x2, data = dat, x = TRUE, y = TRUE)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's not just a string of letters, however.
 It is a call object, a list with individual pieces that we can revise.
 Lines 10 and 11 check the names of mf for the presence of certain arguments,
 and throw away the rest.
 It only wants the arguments we would be needed to run the function model.frame.
 Line 12 adds an argument to the list, drop.unused.levels.
 Up to that point, then, we can look at the individual pieces of mf:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 Line 13 replaces the element 1 in mf with the symbol 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model.frame
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That's the function that will be called.
 Line 14 is the coup de grâce, when the revised call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is sent to eval.
 In the end, it is

\begin_layout Standard
It would not do to simply write that into the lm function, however, because
 some people use variables that have names different from y, x1, and x2,
 and their data objects may not be called dat.
 lm allows users to input whatever they want for a formula and data, and
 then lm takes what it needs to build a model frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
substitute()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most R users I know have not used substitute, except as it arises in the
 plotmath.
 In the context of plotmath, the problem is as follows.
 Plotmath causes the R plot functions to convert expressions into mathematical
 symbols in a way that is reminiscent of LaTeX.
 For example, a command like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

text(4, 4, expression(gamma))
\end_layout

\end_inset

will draw the gamma symbol at the position (4,4).
 We can use paste to combine symbolic commands and text like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

text(4, 4, expression(paste(gamma, " = 7")))
\end_layout

\end_inset

The number 7 is a nice number, but what if we want to calculate something
 and insert it into the expression? Your first guess might be to insert
 a function that makes a calculation, such as the mean, but this fails:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

text(4, 4, expression(paste(gamma, mean(x))))
\end_layout

\end_inset

In order to smuggle the result of a calculation into an expression, some
 fancy footwork is required.
 In the help page for plotmath, examples using the functions bquote and
 substitute are offered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the particular purpose of blending expressions with calculation results,
 I find the bquote function to be more immediately understandable.
 In this section, I'm trying to understand the use of substitute, so let's
 stick with that.
 The plotmath help page points to syntax like this:

Run ?substitute and one is brought to a famous piece of Rchaeological pottery:

\begin_layout Quote
‘substitute’ returns the parse tree for the (unevaluated) expression ‘expr’,

 But 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Really?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one of those points at which being an Rchaeologist has real benefits.
 The manual page gives us some insights into the R programmer, and it is
 his or her view of his or her own actions, but it doesn't necessarily speak
 to how we should understand substitute().
 For me, the only workable approach is to build up a sequence of increasingly
 complicated examples.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I start by creating the list of replacements.
 This replacement list can have a format like this: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

sublist <- list(x1 = "alphabet", x2 = "zoology")
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to replace x1 with alphabet and x2 with zoology.
 The quotes indicate that alphabet and zoology are strings, not other objects
 that already exist.
 Consider:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

substitute(expression(x1 + x2 + log(x1) + x3), sublist)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the substitution 1) leaves other variables alone (since they are
 not named in sublist) and 2) it finds all valid use of the symbols x1 and
 x2 and replaces them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This isn't quite what I wanted, however, because the strings have been inserted
 into the middle of my expression.
 I don't want text.
 I just want symbols.
 It turns out that the functions as.name() and as.symbol() are exactly the
 same, and usually I use as.symbol() because that name has more intuition
 for me, but in Gabor's answer to my question, as.name() is used.
 Using as.name(), so I will illustrate that.

setNames and names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost every R user has noticed that the elements of R lists can have names.
 In a data frame, the names of the list elements are thought of as variable
 names, or column names.
 If dat is a data frame, the names and colnames functions return the same
 thing, but that's not true for other types of objects.

After dat is created, we can change the names inside it with a very similar
 approach:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

<<>>=
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

newnames <- c("whatever","sounds","good","tome")

\begin_layout Plain Layout

colnames(dat)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While used interactively, this is convenient, but it is a bit tedious because
 we have to create dat first, and then set the names.
 The setNames() function allows us to do this in one shot.
 I'll paste the data frame creating commands and the name vector in for
 a first try:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

dat2 <- setNames(data.frame(x1=rnorm(10), x2=rnorm(10), x3=rnorm(10), x4=gl(2,5))
, c("good","names","tough","find"))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

head(dat2, 2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

@
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make this more generally useful, the first step is to take the
 data-frame-creating code and set it into an expression that is not immediately
 evaluated (that's datcommand).
 When I want the data frame to be created, I use eval(), and then the newnames
 vector is put to use.

I don't think most people will actually want that kind of result, but if

If we want to turn biVec1() or biVec2() into general purpose functions,
 we need to start thinking about the problem of unexpected user input.
 Notice what happens if we ask for more 1's than the result vector is supposed
 to contain:

Perhaps I prefer biVec1() because it throws an error when there is unreasonable
 input, while biVec2() returns a longer vector than expected with no error.

If the user mistakenly enters non-integers, neither function generates an
 error, and they give us unexpected output.

Do This, Not That (Stub)

R novices sometimes use Google to search for R advice and they find it,
 good or bad.
 They may find their way to the r-help email list, where advice is generally
 good, or to the StackOverflow pages for R, which may be better.
 A lot of advice is offered by people like me, who may have good intentions,
 but are simply not qualified to offer advice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the few bits of advice that seems to grab widespread support is that
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

for loops are bad.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 One can write an lapply statement in one line, while a for loop can take
 3 lines.
 The code is shorter, but it won't necessarily run more quickly.
 I recall being jarred by this revelation in John Chambers's book, 
\emph on
Software for Data Analysis
\emph default
.
 The members of the apply family (apply, lapply, sapply, etc) can make for
 more readable code, but they aren't always faster.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

However, none of the apply mechanisms changes the number of times the supplied
 function is called, so serious improvements will be limited to iterating
 simple calculations many times.
 Otherwise, the n evaluations of the function can be expected to be the
 dominant fraction of the computation

The components of a project should be small enough so that we can comprehend

 Generally speaking, if we are reading code and we come to a line that uses
 a variable that we cannot find on the screen, that's a problem.
 I used to correspond with a programmer at the University of Michigan who
 said he began to feel uncomfortable when a function filled up the entire
